You make bumps with it. <st bold=\"\">Amazing.</st><br>This is commonly used for just about anything. Screws, bolts, scratches, bumps, dents, carvings, welds, plates...

Just look at the example.<br>The important thing here is that usually at some stage in a PBR shader, the Metalness texture is multiplied by the AO Map.<br>Means that Black AO-Values will kill all of your reflections.<br>Which in turn means that on very metallic objects, it will kill all color and turn your model into a blackhole, from which no light can escape.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><st bold=\"\" color=\"#FFFFFF\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Height Map</st><br>Greyscale texture. 0.5 is \"nothing happens\". Values below means a dent, values above means a bump.<br>Parallax mapping. This displaces the surfaces.<br>Effectively, it means you 3d-ify what is supposed to be a flat surface.
