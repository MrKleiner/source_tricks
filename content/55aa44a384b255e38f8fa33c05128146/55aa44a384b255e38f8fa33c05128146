Apart from personal anecdotes none of these will be mentioned. It is expected you use 2.79 or deal with resulting issues yourself.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>More experienced texture artists might have issues with the way we are porting materials or how they are explained.<br>If you are one of these : I'm happy to take suggestions, but hating and flaming won't bring you anywhere.

Not me!<br>If you must inquire why I don't use it ; 2.93+ doesn't run on my PC. ( There are many other reasons )<br><br>&nbsp;<br><st bold=\"\">BTW, This Tutorial is super long.
