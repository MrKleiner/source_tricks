Hotkeys, Operator Names, Modifiers and more have changed for newer versions.<br>If you decided to use 2.80+, some things may have changed and you might have troubles replicating things in the tutorial.<br>Example : \"Remove Doubles\" operator name is now \"Merge by Distance\". The Boolean Modifier option \"Carve\" does not exist in newer versions, results may be unexpected if using the Exact mode or B-Mesh. Apart from personal anecdotes none of these will be mentioned. It is expected you use 2.79 or deal with resulting issues yourself.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>More experienced texture artists might have issues with the way we are porting materials or how they are explained.<br>If you are one of these : I'm happy to take suggestions, but hating won't bring you anywhere. Keep that in mind!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;TL;DR : This tutorial covers 2.79, not 2.8+. If you mess with 2.8+ get help from Mr.Kleiner#4600. Not me!<br><br>&nbsp;<br>If you must inquire why I don't use it ; 2.93+ doesn't run on my PC. ( There is many other reasons )<br><br>&nbsp;<br><st bold=\"\">BTW, This Tutorial is super long.
