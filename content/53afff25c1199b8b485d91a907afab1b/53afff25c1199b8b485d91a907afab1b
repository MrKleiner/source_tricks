{"atitle":"What is PBR?","boxes":[{"text":"PBR stands for Physically Based Rendering.<br>It was originally introduced to achieve reproduceable results and to make those more realistic.<br>The main reason this is great is because this allows you to use your assets across multiple game engines.<br>The texture maps you use in Game X will be mostly if not entirely the same as in Game Y.<br>Since this is pretty much industry standard right now, nowadays software used to texture models uses PBR or something extremely similar.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Btw,<b> Source does not use any of that</b>. It's shader system is sub-optimal.<br>We will discuss how it works, how to use it and why it sucks. All at a later point.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you create your models using PBR &amp; you decide source sucks,<br>it will be much easier using said assets in other game engines such as Godot, Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.<br><br>For clarification, there is actually 2+ PBR Shaders. They usually get called ;<br>PBR Metallic/Roughness,<br>PBR Specular/Glossiness;<br>We will be focusing on Metallic/Roughness. Which for now, we just shorten to M/R.
